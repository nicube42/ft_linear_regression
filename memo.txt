linear function
gradient descent algorithm

program 1:

    predict price of car for a given mileage.
    Launch program, prompt for a mileage and give estimated price for mileage
    estimatePrice(mileage) = θ0 + (θ1 ∗ mileage)
    Before the run of the training program, theta0 and theta1 will be set to 0.

program 2:

    train model. read dataset file and linear regression data.
    Once the linear regression has completed, you will save the variables theta0 and theta1 for use in the first program.
    Standarize instead of normalise because data is evenly set

    standardized_mileage= std_mileage / mileages−mean_mileage
    Standardization ensures that the data has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which helps gradient descent converge more efficiently.
